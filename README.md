# Language Modeling with PyTorch and Streamlit Deployment

This repository contains a language modeling project using PyTorch, trained on the WikiText-2 dataset, and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. The app has been deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for easy access and interaction.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the process of language modeling using PyTorch. The model is trained on the WikiText-2 dataset, and after training, the model is saved for further use. A Streamlit application is then built to interact with the trained model, allowing users to generate text based on the model's predictions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shgyg99/LanguageModeling.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the environment:**
    Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You may use `venv` or `conda` to create a virtual environment.

## Usage

1. **Train the model:**
    Run the script to train the language model.
    ```bash
    python main_train_loop.py
    ```

2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
    Start the Streamlit app to interact with the trained model.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. **Access the web application:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501/`).

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible online without the need for local setup.
